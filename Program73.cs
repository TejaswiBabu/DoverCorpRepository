/*
 Design patterns are the solutions for Software Designs, 
    these are reusable solutions to the problems that we encounter in the day to day programming. 
They are generally targeted at solving the problems of object generation and integration. 
In other words, Design patterns acts as templates which can be applied to the real-world programming problems.
 

SOLID Principals
Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
A class should take one responsibility and there should be one reason to change that class.
Every class or a module should have responsibility over a single part of the functionality provided by the software that responsibility should entirely encapsulate by that class.
Motivations:
    Maintainability
    Testability
    Flexibility and extensibility
    Parallel Development
    Loosely Coupling
    SOLID principals and Design Pattern play key role in the above motivations
Open Closed Principle(OCP)
In the project, software entities such as classes, modules, functions, etc., should be open for extension but closed for modification.
The new features should be implemented by adding classes, attributes and methods, instead of changing the existing one.
